## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Firebase

Create a `firebase.js` file in the `src` directory with your Firebase configuration:

```javascript
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";

const firebaseConfig = {
  // Your Firebase config here
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
```

### 3. Configure Hugging Face API for OCR

To use the Image OCR feature, you need to:

1. **Get a Hugging Face API Token**:
   - Go to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
   - Create an account or sign in
   - Go to Settings â†’ Access Tokens
   - Create a new token with read permissions

2. **Update the API Token**:
   - Open `src/App.jsx`
   - Find the line: `"Authorization": "Bearer hf_xxx"`
   - Replace `hf_xxx` with your actual Hugging Face API token

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

## OCR Feature Details

The Image OCR feature uses Hugging Face's free tier API with the following models:

- **Primary Model**: `microsoft/trocr-base-handwritten` - Good for handwritten and printed text
- **Fallback Model**: `facebook/tr-ocr` - Alternative OCR model

### OCR Capabilities

- **Text Extraction**: Extract text from images containing medical documents, prescriptions, forms, etc.
- **Language Detection**: Automatically detects Hindi and English text
- **Content Analysis**: Identifies medical documents, prescriptions, and forms
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for extracted text
- **Detailed Explanations**: Offers comprehensive analysis of extracted content

### Usage Tips

1. **Image Quality**: Ensure good lighting and clear text for better results
2. **File Size**: Images should be under 10MB
3. **Supported Formats**: JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP
4. **Privacy**: Medical documents are processed securely but verify extracted text for accuracy

## API Rate Limits

Hugging Face's free tier has rate limits:
- 30,000 requests per month
